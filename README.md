# Loan-status-prediction

The financial area has advanced a ton with numerous individuals applying for loans. Approval
for loan is a vital cycle for banking associations, as advance reimbursement is a significant
contributing variable in the bank's budget or financial statement.

1. Loan approval for clients who will not be able to pay it back may affect the economy of
our country that’s why predicting it right is an important thing to banks.
2. Leaving this choice for bank representatives can be a very ineffective and
time-consuming idea.


Dataset Used and Preprocessing.

For the prediction of the bank loan status, we are going to use a dataset that is available on
Kaggle as “Bank Loan Status Dataset”. To fit the dataset according to our need we will be
mapping string values to the numerical values. Also, we need to handle the null/ NA values that
are present in the dataset.


Learning Techniques.

Currently, as we have planned we are going to use the given machine learning algorithms to train
our model. As a reference we are going to stick with Logistic Regression further we will be
testing our model for Random Forest, Decision Tree and Neural Network (Sequential).
We are planning to use the following techniques as there are very few categorical variables in the
dataset and Random Forest works well with these types of datasets. Also, the size of the initial
dataset is quite large which makes it preferable to use Neural Network techniques.


Evaluation Metrics and Error analysis.

For the given dataset we will be using the binary classifiers to predict whether the person with
the provided details will be able to repay his/her bank loan completely or not. To find the
accuracy of the model we will be using different machine learning models to find the accuracy
and analyse the results from the same. For the analyses of the accuracy and errors from different
models we will be finding them: 1.Accuracy, 2.Precision, 3.Recall, 4.F1-Score, 5.AUC-Score.
